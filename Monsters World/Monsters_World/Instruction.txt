While the hero is on his journey to fight
The Dark Lord, Zork, at his castle,
monsters are hiding everywhere waiting
for the hero to stop him, but it is hard for
them to get into villages and mountains.
The monsters don't love to stay beside each other,
unless they are diagonal to each other.

* If both of them throw the same number, they will
attack simultaneously. one die color represents the
tens-digit, the other the ones-digit. The number
rolled is deducted from the opponent's HP.

hit points.

in a critical hit. Critical hits deduct 100 HP from
the opponent and adds 100 HP to the hero's stats!

the dice and adds the number to their HP.
